> Main [README](https://github.com/jurakovic/cayman-blue/blob/master/README.md) is in master branch.

Cayman Blue is a fork of [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.

It is custom theme used for some of the [jurakovic.github.io](https://jurakovic.github.io) pages. Currently it's not made for general use.
